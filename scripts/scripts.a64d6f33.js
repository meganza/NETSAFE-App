Terms like computer ethics, information ethics, and internet ethics have been used to describe cyber ethics. Most of the communication that happens within the internet are considered non-verbal which means that the people involved cannot gauge each other’s hearing intonation, facial expressions, or body language. This often leads to misinterpretation. Thankfully, this is solved by netiquette. By following netiquette, communication online becomes clearer. </div> </div> </div> <div class="help" ng-show="clickedTool"> <div class="help-modal"> <div class="help-header"> <i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i> Definition of Netiquette <a class="close" ng-click="clickToolTip()"> <i class="fa fa-times"></i> </a> </div> <div class="help-content"> The next suggested topic would be fundamental concepts. </div> </div> </div>'),a.put("views/fundamental.html",'<div class="header"> Fundamental Concepts on Netiquette </div> <br> <div id="tab-1" class="tab" ng-click="showTab(1)"> Conducting Yourself Online </div> <div id="tab-2" class="tab" ng-click="showTab(2)"> Respecting Others Online </div> <div class="tab-content-container"> <div id="tab-content-1" class="tab-content"> <div class="sub-topic"> <button class="cyo-btn" id="cyo-btn-1" ng-click="showCYOVid(1)">Digital Tattoo</button> <button class="cyo-btn" id="cyo-btn-2" ng-click="showCYOVid(2)">Internet Privacy</button> </div> <div id="CYO-video-1" class="CYO-video"> <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9"> <youtube-video class="embed-responsive-item" video-url="digitalTattooVid" player-vars="playerVars"></youtube-video> </div> </div> <div id="CYO-video-2" class="CYO-video"> <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9"> <youtube-video class="embed-responsive-item" video-url="internetPrivacyVid" player-vars="playerVars"></youtube-video> </div> </div> </div> <div id="tab-content-2" class="tab-content"> <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9"> <youtube-video class="embed-responsive-item" video-url="respectingOthersVid" player-vars="playerVars"></youtube-video> </div> </div> <div class="space" ng-show="ppdVal"></div> <div id="suggestedDiscussion" ng-show="ppdVal"> Suggested Discussion </div> <div id="footer"> <button class="prev" ui-sref="netsafe.definition"> ◀︎ Definition of Netiquette </button> <button class="next" ui-sref="netsafe.rules"> Core Rules of Netiquette ▶︎ </button> </div> </div> <div class="help" ng-show="clicked"> <div class="help-modal"> <div class="help-header"> <i class="fa fa-question-circle-o"></i> Fundamental Concepts on Netiquette <a class="close" ng-click="clickHelp()"> <i class="fa fa-times"></i> </a> </div> <div class="help-content"> <div class="sub-topic"> <div class="malwr-help-btn" id="malwr-help-btn-1" ng-click="showHelpTab(1)">Digital Tattoo</div> <div class="malwr-help-btn" id="malwr-help-btn-2" ng-click="showHelpTab(2)">Internet Privacy</div> <div class="malwr-help-btn" id="malwr-help-btn-3" ng-click="showHelpTab(3)">Respecting Others Online</div> </div> <div id="tab-help-content-1" class="tab-help-content"> A digital tattoo represents all the information a user posts online. Photos, text, comments, or other forms of media posted by a user is permanently on the internet even if it was deleted. An internet user’s digital tattoo can also be called a digital footprint. A person’s digital tattoo will affect the person’s reputation especially since companies tend to do research on the background of the people they employ. According to Marie Cooney (n.d.), there are five things you should ask before you post: <br><br> 1. What do I look like? <blockquote> It is important to keep in mind the impression an internet user might leave upon other internet users, considering that that other internet user might be a university or even a company the internet user might be trying to impress. </blockquote> 2. Is this “ink” permanent? <blockquote> A post online is forever in a way that if one thinks that they have already deleted a post, there is still no guarantee that someone else might have already copied or downloaded it. One should always remember that it is easy for other people to copy what an internet user shares online, change it, and share it without the internet user knowing. </blockquote> 3. Am I giving away too much? <blockquote> The more information you share, the more people can learn about you, and the more people learn about you, the more they could use the information against you. </blockquote> 4. Would I want this shared about me? <blockquote> For instance, a netizen shares a picture of their friend online. It is only right that the netizen ask permission to their friend if they would want their photo posted. </blockquote> 5. Does it pass the billboard test? <blockquote> Before you post something online, think: would you be happy to see what you posted on a billboard where the rest of your parents, your grandparents, your neighbors could see it? If not, do you really want to share it? </blockquote> </div> <div id="tab-help-content-2" class="tab-help-content"> Internet Privacy is the level of security and privacy of personal information of an individual. Internet privacy refers to multiple techniques and technologies used to protect data. It is also known as online privacy. Internet privacy is a great concern when it comes to online transactions, the use of social media, visiting online forums and playing online games. If a person’s internet privacy is compromised, the person might fall victim to cyber attacks like identity theft. To avoid risks on internet privacy, use protective software like anti- viruses and firewalls. When shopping, avoid untrusted websites. One should also avoid going to websites with low security always use strong passwords that consist of numbers, letters and special characters.

Photos, text, comments, or other forms of media posted by a user is permanently on the internet even if it was deleted. An internet user’s digital tattoo can also be called a digital footprint. A person’s digital tattoo will affect the person’s reputation especially since companies tend to do research on the background of the people they employ. According to Marie Cooney (n.d.), there are five things you should ask before you post: <br><br> <b>1. What do I look like?</b> <blockquote> It is important to keep in mind the impression an internet user might leave upon other internet users, considering that that other internet user might be a university or even a company the internet user might be trying to impress. </blockquote> <b>2. Is this “ink” permanent?</b> <blockquote> A post online is forever in a way that if one thinks that they have already deleted a post, there is still no guarantee that someone else might have already copied or downloaded it. One should always remember that it is easy for other people to copy what an internet user shares online, change it, and share it without the internet user knowing. </blockquote> <b>3. Am I giving away too much?</b> <blockquote> The more information you share, the more people can learn about you, and the more people learn about you, the more they could use the information against you. </blockquote> <b>4. Would I want this shared about me?</b> <blockquote> For instance, a netizen shares a picture of their friend online. It is only right that the netizen ask permission to their friend if they would want their photo posted. </blockquote> <b>5. Does it pass the billboard test?</b> <blockquote> Before you post something online, think: would you be happy to see what you posted on a billboard where the rest of your parents, your grandparents, your neighbors could see it? If not, do you really want to share it? </blockquote> <div class="sub-topic"> <div class="malwr-help-btn" ui-sref="netsafe.fundamental">Go to Fundamental Concepts on Netiquette</div> </div> </div> <div id="tab-help-content-2" class="tab-help-content"> <b>Internet Privacy</b> is the level of security and privacy of personal information of an individual. Internet privacy refers to multiple techniques and technologies used to protect data. It is also known as online privacy. Internet privacy is a great concern when it comes to online transactions, the use of social media, visiting online forums and playing online games. If a person’s internet privacy is compromised, the person might fall victim to cyber attacks like identity theft. To avoid risks on internet privacy, use protective software like anti- viruses and firewalls. When shopping, avoid untrusted websites. One should also avoid going to websites with low security always use strong passwords that consist of numbers, letters and special characters.

Communicating with others using an electronic device limits the person to only using words. Communication in the form limits the person from using facial expressions, gestures and the tone of their voice. This concept applies to both sides of the conversation. Because of this limitation, misinterpretation could easily happen when communicating via chat, email or posting in discussion groups. A person only sees a computer screen when doing this form of communication; because of this, the person could have a tendency of forgetting that their recipient is a human too. People can express themselves freely and explore what the internet has to offer but one should remember that they are interacting with other people as well. <br> A good practice when conversing online is to ask the question “Would you say it to the person’s face?” If the answer to the question is no then the person should think about rewriting and rereading what they have to say until they feel comfortable about what they are about to send. </blockquote> <table class="core-table" style="width: 100%"> <tr> <th style="width: 50%">Do\'s</th> <th style="width: 50%">Don\'ts</th> </tr> <tr> <td class="table-content" style="text-align: left; font-size: 15px"> <ul> <li style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 25px">Remember you are interacting with people while exploring and expressing yourself on the internet.</li> <li style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 25px">Before you say something, always ask: “Would you say this to the other person’s face?</li> </ul> </td> <td class="table-content" style="text-align: left; font-size: 15px"> <ul> <li style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 25px">Forget that the recipient of your words is a human too.</li> <li style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 25px">Say something that could be considered mean or rude without thinking about it first. </li> <li style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 25px">Say anything that could be saved and used against you.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </table> <div class="sub-topic"> <div class="malwr-help-btn" ui-sref="netsafe.rules">Go to 10 Core Rules of Netiquette</div> </div> </div> <div id="tab-help-content-5" class="tab-help-content"> <h4><b>Adhere the same standards of behavior online that you follow in real life</b></h4> <blockquote>In real life, people follow the law because you can easily get caught. In cyberspace, crime seems to happen more often because it’s a lot harder to track people down. Some people forget that there are also people on the other side of the screen and that poor ethics is more acceptable in the cyber world. This is a common misconception. The standard of behavior for real life and cyberspace are different but they hold equal consequences. Doing illegal actions in cyberspace is bad netiquette. Just because it’s harder to get caught does not mean that it’s okay. </blockquote> <table class="core-table" style="width: 100%"> <tr> <th style="width: 50%">Do\'s</th> <th style="width: 50%">Don\'ts</th> </tr> <tr> <td class="table-content" style="text-align: left; font-size: 15px"> <ul> <li style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 25px">Follow the law.</li> <li style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 25px">Be ethical online.</li> <li style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 25px">Be mindful of your actions on the internet.</li> </ul> </td> <td class="table-content" style="text-align: left; font-size: 15px"> <ul> <li style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 25px">Forget to exercise poor ethics.</li> <li style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 25px">Forget the consequences of your actions on the internet just because you aren’t seen.</li> <li style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 25px">Do illegal actions.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </table> <div class="sub-topic"> <div class="malwr-help-btn" ui-sref="netsafe.rules">Go to 10 Core Rules of Netiquette</div> </div> </div> <div id="tab-help-content-6" class="tab-help-content"> <h4><b>Know where you are in cyberspace </b></h4> <blockquote> Netiquette will vary depending on your domain. The actions a person does in some websites could be okay in their domain but it might not be acceptable behavior in other domains. Posting rumors could be okay in personal blogs but it’s not okay to post that in news forums. If a person is new to the domain they must first look around and browse what’s in the domain and how the people act in the domain.

When sending emails or posting in discussion forums or groups, it is the responsibility of the person to ensure that the content they are posting or sending is worth the time of the reader. Bandwidth is the amount of information that can be carried by wires and channels that connect people in cyberspace. Sending messages and uploading content also take up bandwidth. Posting a similar comment multiple time not only wastes the time of others but also wastes bandwidth. <br> A reminder for this rule is that no one is the center of cyberspace. One should not expect that others will instantaneously respond to your questions and concerns. It is also important to remember that not everyone will agree to what a person has to say no matter how much effort the person has put in making that post or comment. <br> One more idea to think about before posting is who actually needs to read the message. It is easy to send a message to multiple people with the technology we have today and people tend to forget to think about the time they are taking up from the person. If another person does not necessarily need to see the message, then there is no need to send it to them. Only send it to who actually needs it. </blockquote> <table class="core-table" style="width: 100%"> <tr> <th style="width: 50%">Do\'s</th> <th style="width: 50%">Don\'ts</th> </tr> <tr> <td class="table-content" style="text-align: left; font-size: 15px"> <ul> <li style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 25px">Ensure that the long content you’re posting or sending is worth the time of the reader.</li> <li style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 25px">Remember that no one is the center of cyberspace.</li> <li style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 25px">Remember that not everyone will agree to what a person has to say no matter how much effort the person has put in making that post or comment.</li> <li style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 25px">Send whatever you need to send to only those who actually need it.</li> </ul> </td> <td class="table-content" style="text-align: left; font-size: 15px"> <ul> <li style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 25px">Post similar content multiple times.</li> <li style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 25px">Waste people’s time and bandwidth.</li> <li style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 25px">Expect that others will instantaneously respond to your questions and concerns.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </table> <div class="sub-topic"> <div class="malwr-help-btn" ui-sref="netsafe.rules">Go to 10 Core Rules of Netiquette</div> </div> </div> <div id="tab-help-content-8" class="tab-help-content"> <h4><b>Make yourself look good online</b></h4> <blockquote> When a person is communicating online, it is important for them to know what they are talking about. Posting bad information could easily spread in the internet and is open to interpretation to others. People cannot control what others do with the content they put out but it is their responsibility to keep the posts they make themselves as accurate as possible in order to avoid poor interpretation. It is also important to make sure that messages a person posts online are logical and grammatically correct. A good way to do this is to keep it simple. People tend to use long words in order to give a good impression but it tends to lead to the message not making any sense at all. Lastly, people should not use offensive language.

This will help the community grow.<br> If a question has been answered, it is also a good idea to share the results so others can see what people have to say about the question. It’s a good idea to write a summary of the results to make it easier for others to read about the information that have been gathered.

The difference is that in pharming, users are redirected to bogus websites, even if they typed in the correct address. This is common on banks or e-commerce websites. The primary method to pharm comes from DNS cache poisoning where an attack is made against the Internet naming system which allows users to visit a website through meaningful names, compared to a series of numbers or IP addresses. <br><br>You can protect yourself from pharming attacks by using a trustworthy internet service provider. Always check the address bar on the browser. Make sure that once the page has fully loaded, the URL is spelled correctly.

If and when you must provide your personal information, make sure that it is actually the organization’s website and that it is secure. Last but not the least, review credit card and bank account statements as soon as you receive them to check for unauthorized charges.

Communicating with others using an electronic device limits the person to only using words. Communication in the form limits the person from using facial expressions, gestures and the tone of their voice. This concept applies to both sides of the conversation. Because of this limitation, misinterpretation could easily happen when communicating via chat, email or posting in discussion groups. A person only sees a computer screen when doing this form of communication; because of this, the person could have a tendency of forgetting that their recipient is a human too. People can express themselves freely and explore what the internet has to offer but one should remember that they are interacting with other people as well. <br> A good practice when conversing online is to ask the question “Would you say it to the person’s face?” If the answer to the question is no then the person should think about rewriting and rereading what they have to say until they feel comfortable about what they are about to send. </blockquote> </div> <div id="tab-help-content-2" class="tab-help-content"> <h4><b>Adhere the same standards of behavior online that you follow in real life</b></h4> <blockquote>In real life, people follow the law because you can easily get caught. In cyberspace, crime seems to happen more often because it’s a lot harder to track people down. Some people forget that there are also people on the other side of the screen and that poor ethics is more acceptable in the cyber world. This is a common misconception. The standard of behavior for real life and cyberspace are different but they hold equal consequences. Doing illegal actions in cyberspace is bad netiquette. Just because it’s harder to get caught does not mean that it’s okay. </blockquote> </div> <div id="tab-help-content-3" class="tab-help-content"> <h4><b>Know where you are in cyberspace </b></h4> <blockquote> Netiquette will vary depending on your domain. The actions a person does in some websites could be okay in their domain but it might not be acceptable behavior in other domains. Posting rumors could be okay in personal blogs but it’s not okay to post that in news forums. If a person is new to the domain they must first look around and browse what’s in the domain and how the people act in the domain. This will give the person an idea as to how to participate. </blockquote> </div> <div id="tab-help-content-4" class="tab-help-content"> <h4><b>Respect other people’s time and bandwidth</b></h4> <blockquote>People only have limited time. When sending emails or posting in discussion forums or groups, it is the responsibility of the person to ensure that the content they are posting or sending is worth the time of the reader. Bandwidth is the amount of information that can be carried by wires and channels that connect people in cyberspace. Sending messages and uploading content also take up bandwidth. Posting a similar comment multiple time not only wastes the time of others but also wastes bandwidth. <br> A reminder for this rule is that no one is the center of cyberspace. One should not expect that others will instantaneously respond to your questions and concerns. It is also important to remember that not everyone will agree to what a person has to say no matter how much effort the person has put in making that post or comment. <br> One more idea to think about before posting is who actually needs to read the message. It is easy to send a message to multiple people with the technology we have today and people tend to forget to think about the time they are taking up from the person. If another person does not necessarily need to see the message, then there is no need to send it to them. Only send it to who actually needs it. </blockquote> </div> <div id="tab-help-content-5" class="tab-help-content"> <h4><b>Make yourself look good online</b></h4> <blockquote> When a person is communicating online, it is important for them to know what they are talking about. Posting bad information could easily spread in the internet and is open to interpretation to others. People cannot control what others do with the content they put out but it is their responsibility to keep the posts they make themselves as accurate as possible in order to avoid poor interpretation. It is also important to make sure that messages a person posts online are logical and grammatically correct. A good way to do this is to keep it simple. People tend to use long words in order to give a good impression but it tends to lead to the message not making any sense at all. Lastly, people should not use offensive language. Swearing is also not acceptable online. People could do it but it will not do anyone any good. </blockquote> </div> <div id="tab-help-content-6" class="tab-help-content"> <h4><b>Share expert knowledge</b></h4> <blockquote> One advantage to cyberspace is the array of people that others can communicate to. Many of these people can provide answers to questions of their expertise. This is a reason why people tend to ask a lot of questions online. The internet grew because people wanted to share information. <br> A good tip is for people to share the information that they have in order to help others. This will help the community grow.<br> If a question has been answered, it is also a good idea to share the results so others can see what people have to say about the question. It’s a good idea to write a summary of the results to make it easier for others to read about the information that have been gathered. If a person is not an expert on content themselves, they could always post reliable resources where people could look into. <br> </blockquote> </div> <div id="tab-help-content-7" class="tab-help-content"> <h4><b>Help keep flame wars under control</b></h4> <blockquote> Flaming is when people express their opinions without holding back their emotions. Netiquette does not necessarily forbid flaming because flames are entertaining for the most part and most of the time, the recipients of these flames deserve it. Even so, netiquette does allow prolonged flame wars where people send continuous angry text to one another that destroy the camaraderie of the people in the discussion group. Flaming could be entertaining but it gets dull as it progresses longer especially if the person reading is uninvolved. </blockquote> </div> <div id="tab-help-content-8" class="tab-help-content"> <h4><b>Respect other people’s privacy</b></h4> <blockquote> This rule is straightforward and has the same application as to how a person should respect another person’s privacy in real life. Don’t read other people’s personal messages or emails. If the person reading is not the recipient then they are practicing bad netiquette. People should not access information that is not meant to be public or not meant for them to read. </blockquote> </div> <div id="tab-help-content-9" class="tab-help-content"> <h4><b>Don’t abuse your power</b></h4> <blockquote> Some people have higher access online such as system administrators, developers or admins of Multi-user dungeons (MUDs), and experts in every office. Knowing more or having more access online does not give a person the right to abuse it. For example, system admins should never read private emails of employees. </blockquote> </div> <div id="tab-help-content-10" class="tab-help-content"> <h4><b>Be forgiving of other people’s mistakes</b></h4> <blockquote> When someone makes a mistake online, whether misspelled words, grammatical errors, unnecessarily long answer or unintelligent questions, be kind about it. If one decides to inform someone of his/her mistake, he or she must do it politely, and preferably by private email or messages rather than in public. It is also advised to think twice before reacting. </blockquote> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="help" ng-show="clickedTool"> <div class="help-modal"> <div class="help-header"> <i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i> Core Rules on Netiquette <a class="close" ng-click="clickToolTip()"> <i class="fa fa-times"></i> </a> </div> <div class="help-content"> <div style="text-align: center; font-size: 16px"> <b> Understanding the tables </b><br> This is the tab where you can begin to understand what the tables are and how they work in regards with the 10 Core Rules lecture.<br> The oranges boxes could be clicked to expand or compress the contents inside of it. <br><br> </div> <div class="tutorial-steps" ng-click="step1 = !step1"> <span ng-show="!step1"> Show <b>Step 1</b> Do\'s and Dont\'s <b>Table</b></span> <span ng-show="step1"> <b>Step 1:</b> Discuss the current netiquette core rule <br> The table below is for the do\'s and don\'ts for the specific netiquette core rule.
