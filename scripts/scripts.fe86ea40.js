Photos, text, comments, or other forms of media posted by a user is permanently on the internet even if it was deleted. An internet user’s digital tattoo can also be called a digital footprint. A person’s digital tattoo will affect the person’s reputation especially since companies tend to do research on the background of the people they employ. According to Marie Cooney (n.d.), there are five things you should ask before you post: <br><br> 1. What do I look like? <blockquote> It is important to keep in mind the impression an internet user might leave upon other internet users, considering that that other internet user might be a university or even a company the internet user might be trying to impress. </blockquote> 2. Is this “ink” permanent? <blockquote> A post online is forever in a way that if one thinks that they have already deleted a post, there is still no guarantee that someone else might have already copied or downloaded it. One should always remember that it is easy for other people to copy what an internet user shares online, change it, and share it without the internet user knowing. </blockquote> 3. Am I giving away too much? <blockquote> The more information you share, the more people can learn about you, and the more people learn about you, the more they could use the information against you. </blockquote> 4. Would I want this shared about me? <blockquote> For instance, a netizen shares a picture of their friend online. It is only right that the netizen ask permission to their friend if they would want their photo posted. </blockquote> 5. Does it pass the billboard test? <blockquote> Before you post something online, think: would you be happy to see what you posted on a billboard where the rest of your parents, your grandparents, your neighbors could see it? If not, do you really want to share it? </blockquote> <br> <b>Internet Privacy</b><br> Internet Privacy is the level of security and privacy of personal information of an individual. Internet privacy refers to multiple techniques and technologies used to protect data. It is also known as online privacy. Internet privacy is a great concern when it comes to online transactions, the use of social media, visiting online forums and playing online games. If a person’s internet privacy is compromised, the person might fall victim to cyber attacks like identity theft. To avoid risks on internet privacy, use protective software like anti- viruses and firewalls. When shopping, avoid untrusted websites. One should also avoid going to websites with low security always use strong passwords that consist of numbers, letters and special characters.

It can do numerous things on your computer, depending on how they are programmed. Some viruses can damage programs, delete files, creating malicious files or even reformatting the hard drive. Others can replicate itself, flood a network with traffic thus making it difficult to use the internet or even cause frequent computer crashes. (“Computer Virus, n.d.”) <blockquote> Symptoms of virus: <ul> <li>- Slow computer performance </li><li>- Programs/applications wont start </li><li>- Computer reboots on its own </li><li>- Computer restarts continuously </li><li>- Computer lock ups frequently </li><li>- Freezing/ crashing/ not responding </li><li>- texts not printing correctly </li><li>- Disk drives or disks become inaccessible </li><li>- Missing files/ modified files/ infected files </li><li>- OS errors or system errors </li><li>- Appearance of strange desktop files </li><li>- Software not installed by the user </li><li>- Desktop pop ups </li></ul> </blockquote> <b>Trojan </b> <br> This type of malware looks like a genuine program but is actually destructive. A trojan horse can be programmed to steal personal and financial information, and then take over the files of the host computer. (“What are malwares”, n.d. ) <blockquote> Symptoms of Trojan Horse: <ul> <li>- Slow computer performance </li><li>- Computer starts continuously </li><li>- Freezing/ crashing/ not responding </li><li>- Disk drives or disks become inaccessible </li><li>- Missing files/ modified files/ infected files </li><li>- OS errors or system errors </li><li>- Desktop pop ups </li><li>- Installed malicious games </li><li>- Using infected portable storage </li><li>- Downloading suspicious files from email </li></ul> </blockquote> <b>Worms</b> <br> Worms replicate itself and destroys files on the host computer. It takes up all system operating files and data files on a drive. <blockquote> Symptoms of worms: <ul> <li>- Slow computer performance </li><li>- Computer restarts on its own </li><li>- Freezing/ crashing/ not responding </li><li>- Disk drives or disks become inaccessible </li><li>- Missing files/ modified files/ infected files </li><li>- OS errors or system errors </li><li>- Error messages pop up when win32 folder is opened </li></ul> </blockquote> <b>Adware</b> <br> Adwares are a software application where advertising banners are displayed while any program is running.

Remember the human</b> <blockquote> This rule is similar to the expression “Do unto others as you’d have others do unto you”. Communicating with others using an electronic device limits the person to only using words. Communication in the form limits the person from using facial expressions, gestures and the tone of their voice. This concept applies to both sides of the conversation. Because of this limitation, misinterpretation could easily happen when communicating via chat, email or posting in discussion groups. A person only sees a computer screen when doing this form of communication; because of this, the person could have a tendency of forgetting that their recipient is a human too. People can express themselves freely and explore what the internet has to offer but one should remember that they are interacting with other people as well. <br> A good practice when conversing online is to ask the question “Would you say it to the person’s face?” If the answer to the question is no then the person should think about rewriting and rereading what they have to say until they feel comfortable about what they are about to send. </blockquote> <b>2. Adhere the same standards of behavior online that you follow in real life</b> <blockquote>In real life, people follow the law because you can easily get caught. In cyberspace, crime seems to happen more often because it’s a lot harder to track people down. Some people forget that there are also people on the other side of the screen and that poor ethics is more acceptable in the cyber world. This is a common misconception. The standard of behavior for real life and cyberspace are different but they hold equal consequences. Doing illegal actions in cyberspace is bad netiquette. Just because it’s harder to get caught does not mean that it’s okay. </blockquote> <b>3. Know where you are in cyberspace </b> <blockquote> Netiquette will vary depending on your domain. The actions a person does in some websites could be okay in their domain but it might not be acceptable behavior in other domains. Posting rumors could be okay in personal blogs but it’s not okay to post that in news forums. If a person is new to the domain they must first look around and browse what’s in the domain and how the people act in the domain. This will give the person an idea as to how to participate. </blockquote> <b>4. Respect other people’s time and bandwidth</b> <blockquote>People only have limited time. When sending emails or posting in discussion forums or groups, it is the responsibility of the person to ensure that the content they are posting or sending is worth the time of the reader. Bandwidth is the amount of information that can be carried by wires and channels that connect people in cyberspace. Sending messages and uploading content also take up bandwidth. Posting a similar comment multiple time not only wastes the time of others but also wastes bandwidth. <br> A reminder for this rule is that no one is the center of cyberspace. One should not expect that others will instantaneously respond to your questions and concerns. It is also important to remember that not everyone will agree to what a person has to say no matter how much effort the person has put in making that post or comment. <br> One more idea to think about before posting is who actually needs to read the message. It is easy to send a message to multiple people with the technology we have today and people tend to forget to think about the time they are taking up from the person. If another person does not necessarily need to see the message, then there is no need to send it to them. Only send it to who actually needs it. </blockquote> <b>5. Make yourself look good online</b> <blockquote> When a person is communicating online, it is important for them to know what they are talking about. Posting bad information could easily spread in the internet and is open to interpretation to others. People cannot control what others do with the content they put out but it is their responsibility to keep the posts they make themselves as accurate as possible in order to avoid poor interpretation. It is also important to make sure that messages a person posts online are logical and grammatically correct. A good way to do this is to keep it simple. People tend to use long words in order to give a good impression but it tends to lead to the message not making any sense at all. Lastly, people should not use offensive language. Swearing is also not acceptable online. People could do it but it will not do anyone any good. </blockquote> <b>6. Share expert knowledge</b> <blockquote> One advantage to cyberspace is the array of people that others can communicate to. Many of these people can provide answers to questions of their expertise. This is a reason why people tend to ask a lot of questions online. The internet grew because people wanted to share information. <br> A good tip is for people to share the information that they have in order to help others. This will help the community grow.<br> If a question has been answered, it is also a good idea to share the results so others can see what people have to say about the question. It’s a good idea to write a summary of the results to make it easier for others to read about the information that have been gathered. If a person is not an expert on content themselves, they could always post reliable resources where people could look into. <br> </blockquote> <b> 7. Help keep flame wars under control</b> <blockquote> Flaming is when people express their opinions without holding back their emotions. Netiquette does not necessarily forbid flaming because flames are entertaining for the most part and most of the time, the recipients of these flames deserve it. Even so, netiquette does allow prolonged flame wars where people send continuous angry text to one another that destroy the camaraderie of the people in the discussion group. Flaming could be entertaining but it gets dull as it progresses longer especially if the person reading is uninvolved. </blockquote> <b>8. Respect other people’s privacy</b> <blockquote> This rule is straightforward and has the same application as to how a person should respect another person’s privacy in real life. Don’t read other people’s personal messages or emails. If the person reading is not the recipient then they are practicing bad netiquette. People should not access information that is not meant to be public or not meant for them to read. </blockquote> <b>9. Don’t abuse your power</b> <blockquote> Some people have higher access online such as system administrators, developers or admins of Multi-user dungeons (MUDs), and experts in every office. Knowing more or having more access online does not give a person the right to abuse it. For example, system admins should never read private emails of employees. </blockquote> <b>10. Be forgiving of other people’s mistakes</b> <blockquote> When someone makes a mistake online, whether misspelled words, grammatical errors, unnecessarily long answer or unintelligent questions, be kind about it.
